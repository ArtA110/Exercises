Sina and Nima are USVAJAK agents tracking the movements of an unnamed corrupt government official. Anonymous sources have informed them about his upcoming escape attempt. They now know he plans to use his diplomatic contacts to try and hitch a ride on a CIA jet leaving from Jabolgha airport.

Itâ€™s well-known that all CIA jets have the string FBI somewhere in their registration codes. They gathered a list of all jets scheduled for the designated day. There are exactly five jets on the list. Write a program that will find out all CIA jets.

Input
There are exactly 55 rows of input, each row representing exactly one jet registration code from the list. A registration code is a sequence of at most 1010 uppercase English letters, digits 0 to 9, or dashes -.

Output
The only line of output must contain a list of integers, indicating the corresponding input rows containing registrations of CIA jets, sorted in increasing order.

If there are no CIA jets, output the string HE GOT AWAY!.

Note: Uppercase and Lowercase letters are considered different, so He Got Away! is wrong!
