We throw a smartphone in the sea, the phone hits the sea and comes up and
hits the sea <n> times and in nth time it will no longer comes up.

if we throw the smartphone <d> meter, each time the phone hits the sea and
comes up travel <d/2> of previous time.
hint : T = d+(d/2)+(d/4)...

if in the end (when smartphone sank!) the smartphone move <T> meters and we know
how many times smartphone hits water calculate <d>!

we give the program total distance(T) and hit times(n), program should calculate
the distance that we throw the smartphone(d)!
